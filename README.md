# useEffect Cleanup Function Not Always Called on Unmount

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook might not be called reliably on component unmount.

## The Problem

In certain situations, particularly when dealing with fast component updates or complex state management, the cleanup function within `useEffect` may not be executed before the component is removed from the DOM.  This can lead to issues like:

* **Memory leaks:** If the cleanup function is responsible for releasing resources (e.g., closing network connections, clearing timers), failure to call it might result in unused memory.
* **Unexpected behavior:** If the cleanup function performs actions that affect other parts of the application, skipping it might lead to inconsistencies.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a component that demonstrates the problematic behavior.  Run the app and observe the console output.  Try to rapidly mount and unmount the component to reproduce the issue.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to mitigate this problem by using techniques like careful dependency management and ensuring proper cleanup mechanisms.
